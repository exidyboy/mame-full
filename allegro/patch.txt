This patch must be applied over Allegro 3.9.31 to fix a couple of bugs that
affect normal operation.

The fixed bugs are:
1) 400x300 VESA modes not working.
2) some default parameters for tweaked modes being saved to mame.cfg with a
   leading 0, and not being recognized afterwards.

Don't forget to recompile the library after applying the patch!
