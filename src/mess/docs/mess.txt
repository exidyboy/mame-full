                   ==========================================
                   
Please note that many people helped with this project, either directly or by
releasing source code which was used to write the drivers. We are not trying to
appropriate merit which isn't ours. See the acknowledgemnts section for a list
of contributors, however please note that the list is largely incomplete. See
also the CREDITS section in the emulator to see the people who contributed to a
specific driver. Again, that list might be incomplete. We apologize in advance
for any omission.

All trademarks cited in this document are property of their respective owners.

Especially, the MESS team would like to thank Nicola Salmoria and the MAME team 
for letting us play with their code and, in fact, incorporating MESS specific 
code into MAME.  Without it, MESS would be substantially less than what it is 
right now! ;-)


Usage and Distribution Licence:
===============================

- MESS usage and distribution follows that of MAME.  Please read the MAME 
  readme.txt file distributed with MESS for further information.



How to Contact The MESS Team
============================

Here are some of the people contributing to MESS. If you have comments,
suggestions or bug reports about an existing driver, check the driver's Credits
section to find who has worked on it, and send comments to that person. If you
are not sure who to contact, write to Ben (ben@netstra.com.au) - who is the 
current coordinator of the MESS project [DOS]. If you have comments specific to a
given operating system, they should be sent to the respective port maintainer.
You will find their e-mail address below.

PLEASE DON'T SEND BINARY ATTACHMENTS WITHOUT ASKING FIRST, *ESPECIALLY* ROM IMAGES.

THESE ARE NOT SUPPORT ADDRESSES. Support questions sent to these addresses
*will* be ignored. Please understand that this is a *free* project, mostly
targeted at experienced users. We don't have the resources to provide end user
support. Basically, if you can't get the emulator to work, you are on your own.
First of all, read this doc carefully. If you still can't find an answer to
your question, try checking the beginner's sections that many emulation pages
have, or ask on the appropriate Usenet newsgroups (e.g. comp.emulators.misc)
or on the many emulation message boards.  The official MESS message board is at:
          http://mess.emuverse.com


Also, DO NOT SEND REQUESTS FOR NEW SYSTEMS TO ADD, unless you have some original
info on the hardware or, even better, have the technical expertise needed to
help us. Please don't send us information widely available on the Internet -
we are perfectly capable of finding it ourselves, thank you.

MESS USAGE
==========

MESS <system> <[file1] [file2] [file...]> <options>

*For a complete list of systems emulated,  use: MESS -listfull
*For system files required by each system, use: MESS <system> -listroms
*See the MAME readme.txt for a detailed list of options.
*make sure you have roms in a subdirectory from your ROMPATH
 with the same name as the system (eg ROMS/COLECO)

Examples:

MESS nes zelda.nes
        will run MESS in the following way:
         <system>  = nes             (Nintendo Entertainment System) 
         <file1>   = zelda.nes       (Zelda cartridge)
         <options> = default options (all listed in mess.cfg)
	
MESS coleco dkong.rom -soundcard 0
        will run MESS in the following way:
         <system>  = coleco          (Nintendo Entertainment System) 
         <file1>   = dkong.rom       (Donkey Kong cartridge)
         <options> = default options but without sound
        
MESS trs80 boot.dsk arcade1.dsk
        will run MESS in the following way:
         <system>  = trs80           (TRs-80 model 1)
         <file1>   = boot.dsk        (The Trs80 boot diskl)
         <file2>   = arcade1.dsk     (Disk which contains games)
         <options> = default options (all listed in mess.cfg)
	
MESS cgenie games1.dsk
	will run the system Colour Genie with one disk image loaded
	


A NOTE ABOUT FILES:  
     - Place files to be loaded in a subdirectory from you rompath with the 
       same name as the system you want to run.  
       (eg) ROMPATH = C:\MESS\ROMS;
            The files for the coleco system would be placed here: 
                      C:\MESS\ROMS\COLECO 
     - You can also specify the exact path to a file in the ROMPATH.

     - You can now specify switches on the commandlinem in which case 
       every image name following them goes to that respective slot, 
       regardless of it's extension.

       Some examples:
          ; recognized by extension
          mess a800 mule.xfd
          mess oric1 game.tap
          ; 'slot' overrides
          mess vic20 -cassette a.dsk b.img c.d64 -floppy d.cas
          mess amiga -floppy itdesert.adf
       The switches are -rom, -floppy, -harddisk and -cassette.
       Recognized extensions without overrides are now:
        cassette:	cas, cmd, tap, t64, vz
        harddisk:	img
        floppy:		d64, dsk, adf, atr, xfd, vzd
        roms:		everything else
