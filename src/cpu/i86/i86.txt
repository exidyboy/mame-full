8086 remarks:
20 bit address bus
16 bit databus
6 byte instruction prefetch buffer
memory cycle in min 4 cycles

8086/8088 errors:


Differences between NEC V20 and 8088:
pin compatible (for the V20 and V30 i am sure) and changable
faster operation
additional operations
(ins,ext insert, remove bitfield)
(add4s, sub4s, cmp4s add, substract, compare packed decimal string)
(rol4, ror4 rotate one bcd digit left, right)
(test1, not1, clr1, set1 test, invert, clear or set one bit)
(repc,repnc repeat next operation until carry set, cleared)
(fpo2 call mathematic coprocessor)
all 80286 realmode operations (other mnemonic, same opcode and behaviour)
8080 emulation mode
V20 much like the 8088
V30 much like the 8086
V40 much like the 80188
V50 much like the 80186

Differences between 8086 and 8088:
8 bit databus

Differences between 8086/8088 and 80186/80188:
??memory access in 2 cycles
additional operations
(pusha, popa: push or pop all register)
(enter, leave: create or remove procedure frame on stack)
(ins, outs: input or output of string)
(bound: )
(shl, shr: shift left, right register n times)
(rol, ror: rotate left, right register n times)
(rolc, rorc: rotate left, right through carry flag n times)
(push: push immediate value)
(mul multiply reg or memory with immediate value)
some integrated peripherals (timer?,...)

Differences between 8086 and 80286:
memory access in min 2 cycles
additional 80186 instructions
24 bit address bus
faster operation
protected mode

Difference between 80286 and 80386:
faster operation
32 bit address bus
32 bit databus
32 bit mode
additional segment register fs, gs
additional flags
additional addressing modes
paging unit
additional operations
(movzx, movsx mov with zero, sign extension)
(bt, btc, btr, bts test bit, test bit and complement, reset, set)
(jexcz jump on ecx zero)
(bsf, bsr bit scan forward, reverse)
(setb, setbe, sete, setne, setnb, setae, seta,
 set byte on below, below or equal, equal, not equal, above or equal, above)
(setl, setle, setge, setg
 set byte on less, less or equal, greater or equal, greater)
(seto, setno, setp, setnp, sets, setns 
 set byte on overflow, parity, sign set or not set)
(shld, shrd shift left, right double)
(lfs, lgs, lss)
(clts)
8086 emulation mode (v86 mode)

Difference between 80386 and 80386sx:
24 bit address bus
16 bis data bus

the other are more and more complex and not so interesting here
