0.37 BETA 3

----------------------------------

  [Maurizio Zanello]

- Lots of changes to some CPU cores (mostly i86). I186 support. [Peter Trauner,
  Juergen Buchmueller, Aaron Giles]

- Preliminary MIPS CPU emulation. [smf]

- New makefile, easier to port, split into multiple files. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- New modes for drawgfx(): TRANSPARENCY_NONE_RAW, TRANSPARENCY_PEN_RAW,
  TRANSPARENCY_PENS_RAW, TRANSPARENCY_THROUGH_RAW. The purpose of these is to
  allow you to work in "raw" colorspace (that is, unremapped pens) and then
  perform the palette lookup at the end. This is useful for a number of games
  that do collision detection or foreground/background blends (e.g., the palette
  index is ((fgpen << 4) | bgpen)).
  When you use these modes, the "color" parameter doesn't refer to the palette
  any longer. Instead, it is just a value that is added to the raw pen value
  of the graphics you are drawing. That way, if your background layer uses
  pens 0-63 and your foreground layer uses pens 64-127, you can pass in a
  color of 0 when drawing the background layer and 64 when drawing the
  foreground.
  Also added copybitmap_remap() and copyscrollbitmap_remap(). These take the
  same parameters as the originals, but don't make the assumption that
  TRANSPARENCY_NONE means TRANSPARENCY_NONE_RAW (which, if you think about it,
  is the way they work).
  This means that you can do all your work with raw palette indexes until the
  very end, and then do a copybitmap_remap(TRANSPARENCY_NONE) to copy the
  result and do the remap step in the end.
  Finally, there's a new pair of modes that are only supported in
  copybitmap(): TRANSPARENCY_BLEND and TRANSPARENCY_BLEND_RAW. For these
  modes, the source bitmap is shifted left by the "color" parameter and then
  ORed into the destination bitmap. This lets you compute the palette indexes
  (and optionally do the lookup) for games that look up the palette by
  combining forground and background pen indices. [Aaron Giles]

- Moved logerror() from mame.c to the OS dependant code, and removed errorlog
  from the GameOptions structure.

- Major redesign of the artwork support. All the drivers need to do is call
  overlay_create() or overlay_load() and the rest is handled by the core.
  Opacity/translucency support in 16-bit mode.  Check out Space Invaders for
  example, the colored strips that make up the overlay is faintly visible
  under the black areas. [Mathis Rosenhauer, Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed YM2608 adpcm support. [Aaron Giles]

Other drivers changes:
----------------------

  Time Solders rev 1. [Bryan McPhail]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Massive rewrite of the cheat system user interface. This is still a work
  in progress. [Brad Oliver]

- First pass for multi language support with external translation files.
  [Brad Oliver]

- Extended the internal font to support characters 128-255 (ISO Latin-1).
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed Hu6280 emulation bugs which caused missing levels in Trio the Punch.
  [Bryan McPhail]


Source:
-------

- Replaced instances of "if (errorlog) fprintf(errorlog," with a call to the
  new function logerror().

- New filetypes that must be supported by the OS dependant code:
  FILETYPE_HIGHSCORE_DB
  FILETYPE_HISTORY
  FILETYPE_CHEAT
  FILETYPE_LANGUAGE

  new functions:
  osd_readkey_unicode
  osd_fgetc
  osd_ungetc
  osd_fgets
  osd_feof
  osd_ftell

  new filed in struct Gameoptions: language_file. The OS dependant code must
  initialize it if it wants to use a translation file.
  [Brad Oliver]

- I added a new parameter to the end of the EEPROM interface to enable multiple
  reads to occur after a single read command. Added an EEPROM_set_data()
  routine that can be used to explicitly initialize the contents of the EEPROM
  if the NVRAM file isn't found. [Aaron Giles]

0.37 BETA 1

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Background in Exerion. [Aaron Giles]

- Artwork support in Space Encounters. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed sprite colors in the MCR2 games, however overlapping sprites are still
  wrong. [Aaron Giles]

- Samples support in Got-Ya. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Sound in Berlin Wall. [Luca Elia]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Support for 24-bit artwork. [Mathis Rosenhauer]


Source:
-------

- Support for a priority buffer, updated by tilemap.c, which can be used to
  draw sprites using the new function pdrawgfx(). This allowed to fix many
  tile/sprite priority bugs e.g. in Ajax, Lightning Thunder, Simpsons,
  Vendetta, Punk Shot, Gradius III and others.
  [Phil Stroffolino, Nicola Salmoria]

- Change the API for tilemap_mark_tile_dirty() and the get_tile_info hooks,
  now a single parameter tile_index is used instead of (col,row). A function
  passed to tilemap_create() does the (col,row)->tile_index mapping, two
  standard functions are provided for the common cases.
  All drivers have been converted to the new API except for namcos2.c, which
  is therefore broken at the moment. [Phil Stroffolino]

- New GAME_UNEMULATED_PROTECTION flag.

- 6803/63701 external port writes no longer set to 1 the bits that are set as
  inputs in the DDR register. Instead, they are set to the value returned by a
  read from the port. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Updated all memory handlers to the new READ_HANDLER()/WRITE_HANDLER() macro
  declarations. The old "function(int offset,int data)" style must not be used
  anymore.
