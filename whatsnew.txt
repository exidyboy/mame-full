Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Massive rewrite of the cheat system user interface. This is still a work
  in progress. [Brad Oliver]

- First pass for multi language support with external translation files.
  [Brad Oliver]

- Extended the internal font to support characters 128-255 (ISO Latin-1).
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

  [Bryan McPhail]


Source:
-------

- Replaced instances of "if (errorlog) fprintf(errorlog," with a call to the
  new function logerror().

- New filetypes that must be supported by the OS dependant code:
  FILETYPE_HIGHSCORE_DB
  FILETYPE_HISTORY
  FILETYPE_CHEAT
  FILETYPE_LANGUAGE

  new functions:
  osd_readkey_unicode
  osd_fgetc
  osd_ungetc
  osd_fgets
  osd_feof
  osd_ftell

  new filed in struct Gameoptions: language_file. The OS dependant code must
  initialize it if it wants to use a translation file.
  [Brad Oliver]

- I added a new parameter to the end of the EEPROM interface to enable multiple
  reads to occur after a single read command. Added an EEPROM_set_data()
  routine that can be used to explicitly initialize the contents of the EEPROM
  if the NVRAM file isn't found. [Aaron Giles]

==========================================================================


0.37 BETA 1

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Background in Exerion. [Aaron Giles]

- Artwork support in Space Encounters. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Fixed sprite colors in the MCR2 games, however overlapping sprites are still
  wrong. [Aaron Giles]

  samples are still required). [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Completed sound in Splash. [Manuel Abadia]

- Samples support in Got-Ya. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Sound in Berlin Wall. [Luca Elia]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Support for 24-bit artwork. [Mathis Rosenhauer]


Source:
-------

- Support for a priority buffer, updated by tilemap.c, which can be used to
  draw sprites using the new function pdrawgfx(). This allowed to fix many
  tile/sprite priority bugs e.g. in Ajax, Lightning Thunder, Simpsons,
  Vendetta, Punk Shot, Gradius III and others.
  [Phil Stroffolino, Nicola Salmoria]

- Change the API for tilemap_mark_tile_dirty() and the get_tile_info hooks,
  now a single parameter tile_index is used instead of (col,row). A function
  passed to tilemap_create() does the (col,row)->tile_index mapping, two
  standard functions are provided for the common cases.
  All drivers have been converted to the new API except for namcos2.c, which
  is therefore broken at the moment. [Phil Stroffolino]

- New GAME_UNEMULATED_PROTECTION flag.

- 6803/63701 external port writes no longer set to 1 the bits that are set as
  inputs in the DDR register. Instead, they are set to the value returned by a
  read from the port. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

- Updated all memory handlers to the new READ_HANDLER()/WRITE_HANDLER() macro
  declarations. The old "function(int offset,int data)" style must not be used
  anymore.
