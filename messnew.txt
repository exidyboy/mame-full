Note: .inp record/playback does still not work currently.
Note: DOS image loading at the command line has changed.  see below


New System Drivers Supported (in no particular order):
------------------------------------------------------
MSX1 UK [Sean Young]
C16 (c1551)   [Peter Trauner]
Plus4 (c1551) [Peter Trauner]


System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- COCO/Dragon - Implemented several obscure video modes (CoCo 3), fixes a bug in 
  flashing on hires text (CoCo 3), implemented the CoCo 3 timer, added several new 
  additional key mappings so things like backspace work [Nate Woods]

- CBM family bugfixes, C64/C128 Mouse support, VIC20 Dipswitches fixes
  [Peter Trauner]

-Msx system driver bug fixes.  [Sean Young]  Also, for the latest news regarding 
 this excellent system driver, check out his MSX1 WIP page at:
 http://www.msxnet.org/mess/



Other Changes:
--------------

- [DOS] Images specified at the command line must now be accompanied by the device they 
  are to be attached to, and will not be loaded unless the device is specified *and* 
  supported by that system.  Eg, to attach a cartridge for the NES, you must specify: 
  MESS nes -cart galaga.nes
  This may affect the usage of frontends, however it brings the MESS command line 
  into sync with the well accepted MAME convention.  See mess.txt for options and 
  usage.

- The core is based on MAME 0.36RC2. This incorporates all 
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team] 

- Image CRC's for clones can now be retreived from the parent named CRC file [Sean Young]

- IO_QUICKLOAD for CBM system drivers.  [Peter Trauner]

- M65CE02 changes [Peter Trauner]

- File Manager now much more user friendly [Kev Thacker, Juergen Buchmueller]

- Note that -listextensions has been renamed to -listdevices. Use this to obtain 
  valid device names for use at the command line to attach images to the system.

- Extensive CRC updates.

System Driver Changes:
----------------------
- Apple2 driver keyboard fix 	 [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Small bug in the 6522 emulator fixed. [Gordon Jefferyes]

- Ti99 series update. [Raphael Nabet]

- ColecoVision Video refresh fixed. [Sean Young]

- Improved SMS/GG driver. New features include Fixed bankswitching/RAM 
  problem, YM2413 support and enable switch, console territory switch, 
  remaining input ports mapped (Player 2, etc.), and split up I/O port map 
  for SMS and GG. Compatability has been improved significantly, however, 
  games that use on-cart RAM will not work properly. [Charles MacDonald]

- MSX system update which includes FM-PAC emulation, SRAM ( uses the YM2413
  emulation), Added support for the device_extrainfo (...) call for the 
  cartridge mapper type, R-Type and Gall force cartridge mapper emulation, 
  and support for Konami's Synthesizer DAC [Sean Young]

- Amiga driver fixes! Notes: You will have to redefine some of the 
  button(s) to your mouse buttons when using the mouse (You cant bind 
  them directly from the driver).  You can select to have either mouse 
  or joystick attached to the ports through the dipswitches.  The 
  Amiga detects external drives by querying them. Right now, only 
  drives are added to the the system which have an image in them. There 
  is still no keyboard emulation.   This version supports many more 
  gfx modes, sprites, input modes, etc and compatibility with many 
  software has increased.  Rewrote large portions of the floppy controller.  
  More games should load properly now.  Moved things around using banks, 
  wHich decreased the overall memory requeriments for the driver from 16 
  megs to 2 megs.  Removed the extra 'chip' and 'extended' ram from the 
  default configuration. The current memory setup should be the same as a 
  stock A500.[Ernesto Corvi]

- Huge update to the a800 family drivers.  Be sure to check the new key mappings 
  using the on screen display (TAB key).  [Juergen Buchmueller]
 
- a5200 keypad problems (finally) solved. only player #1 keypad supported.
  analog joystick still sort of sluggish, but useable in many games.  Be sure 
  to check the new key mappings using the on screen display (TAB key)
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- a7800 palette modified [Juergen Buchmueller, Julian Eggebrecht]

- COCO: Added support for true lower case in lores text modes, and special 
  characters in hires text modes for the CoCo 3 and added a "blur 
  correction" mode for artifact colors in an attempt to make artifact 
  colors be displayed more accurately.  Fixed a few CoCo III related bugs; most 
  notably with PAK loading.  The CoCo driver will now recognize .PAK files that 
  contain snapshot information (meaning that most .PAK files on the net will now 
  work).  In addition, .PAK files are now loaded as IO_SNAPSHOT, rather than 
  IO_CARTSLOT. Implemented the previously unimplemented graphics modes 
  (G1C/G1R/G2C/G2R), enabled the fancy semigraphic modes; on the CoCo one could 
  change the VDG as one mode but tell the SAM (synchronous address multiplexer) 
  to feed data to the VDG as if a different video mode was done.  This created the 
  semigraphic modes that were used in games like Protector.  Plot_pixel() is now used 
  instead of assuming 8-bit bitmaps.  [Nate Woods]

- Amstrad fixes include disk image handling, and loading (disk image handling 
  is now shared between Amstrad and Spectrum drivers, and loading/saving from WAV).
  [David Robertson, Kev Thacker]

- Spectrum changes include disk Image support for +3, loading/saving from WAV, 
  Spectrum+/Spectrum 128 keyboard mappings, Improved I/O decoding (Kempston active 
  on all ports xx1f), support for .TAP tape files (use the normal LOAD"" when 
  emulation starts. In Normal Speccy mode press "J" then SHIFT+P ), and Full key 
  descriptions, and 128k .z80 images not loaded.  Also includes "Issue 2" and 
  "Issue 3" emulation. [David Robertson, Kev Thacker]

- VZ family of drivers update includes IO_CASSETTE now handles wav/cas files, and 
  IO_SNAPSHOT added to quick-load the VZEm files (*.vz)	  [Juergen Buchmueller]



Other Changes:
--------------
- Image CRC matching returns! [Alot of people]

- Important inclusions for this release:
  *wave sound interface and IODevice handler
  *speaker sound driver (replaces the buzzer code)
  *preliminary file manager
  *mess_printf() which checks for gui_host
  Check the UI (TAB) for handling options for most of the above.

- Added support to automagically append or replace extensions for files 
  opened with image_fopen(), which means, if opening a given filename 
  fails (also from the optional clone_of parent driver), the code replaces 
  or appends the next available extension and tries again.   Therefore, there 
  is no need to actually supply the file extension to the command line.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Generic M6847 code  [Nate Woods]

- correct coco3 system BIOS support 
  [Tadd Underhill, Juergen Buchmueller, Nate Woods]

- The core is based on MAME 0.36RC1. This incorporates all 
  features of the update to this core.  [MAME team] 
  (also Allegro 3.9.31 400x300 and config file bugfixes used)

- 6509 Core [Peter Trauner, Juergen Buchmueller]

- Extensive CRC updates.

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Adventurevision LED flicker added [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Palette colors for Vtech2 series of system drivers fixed.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Amstrad mode 2 fix [Kev Thacker]

- PMODE 4 artifact colors in the CoCo drivers.  The COCO had 
  a black and white video mode that actually had two more 
  colors in there that were created because the TV couldn't 
  actually handle the high resolution.  These colors would not 
  appear on some monitors, and when they did appear, they would 
  sometimes switch back and forth.  Added a "dip switch" to the 
  driver to control how these artifact colors are displayed, 
  if at all. [Nate Woods]

- CoCo 3 CMP/RGB color sets - the CoCo 3 had different color sets 
  depending on whether a composite monitor/tv was used, or whether 
  an RGB monitor was used.   Now the CoCo 3 driver can emulate 
  either display, and this is controlled from another dip switch.
  [Nate Woods]

- Apple2 driver changed to use 'normalized' character and graphics 
  layout.  The scanlines are now done by the hosts video code.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- atari pallette changes [Julian Eggebrecht, Juergen Buchmueller]

- atari video timing fixed! [Juergen Buchmueller] 

- fixed dirty char update in Spectrum driver [Kev Thacker]

- Atari "mega disk" supported (80 Track HD floppies)
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Wd179x disk access update.  The correct sector size is now 
  calculated for the nec765 real FDD access.  Now it is calculated 
  from sector size. Loading from real disc works on Enterprise 
  emulator.  [Kev Thacker]

- Updates to Cgenie, Trs80 and ti99_4a due to wd179x update.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Far better disk support in the COCO drivers.  
  [Paul Burgin, Stewart Orchard, Nate Woods]

- Fixed cartridge banking bug in the a800 driver.  BASIC.ROM can be 
  loaded again [Juergen Buchmueller]


- void via_set_clock(int which,int clock); added to 6522via.c.  This 
  can be called after via_config() to change the clock, otherwise the 
  clock speed of CPU1 is used. [Mathis Rosenhauer] 

- added support to load some .Z80 type snapshots in the spectrum 
  driver. (48k only supported at this time) [Kev Thacker]

- Enterprise driver working with disc images or real discs and should 
  work properly with new IO structures. [Kev Thacker]

- huge MSX update, which includes rom mapper emulation for nearly all 
  type of cartridges (including saving sram as MEMCARD), SIMPL 
  emulation, fixed interrupt emulation, added key-click emulation, and 
  small bugfixes / rewrites! [Sean Young]

- ti99 update [Raphael Nabet]

  to loading real discs - it doesn't work yet though.  From basic 
  enter ":EXDOS" to enter a CLI. From here you can type DOS like 
  commands e.g. DIR, CHDIR, MKDIR to access the drive.  From basic 
  you can enter the same commands, but prefix with ":".
  [Kev Thacker]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------
- mess/msdos.c & mess/msdos.h created for MESS DOS specific functions.
  Note: Each port is now responsible for handling these functions.

- there have been major changes to the Driver structures and loading procedure.  

*Here is an overview:

* Every game driver's struct GameDriver (src/mess/systems/*.c) is now
defined using one of four macros COMP/COMPX or CONS/CONSX.
COMP is for computers and CONS is for consoles. The X versions allow
specifying additional flags (GAME_NOT_WORKING ect.)

* Every game driver specifies it's peripherals in an array of
"struct IODevice" elements.

* rom_load and rom_id fields were moved into that list, together with
the number of devices and the known file extensions for images of that
type.

* MAME's src/driver.h now only contains one pointer to this list of
devices, all of MESS' extra fields are gone.
Old:
#ifdef MESS
    int (*rom_load)(void);
    int (*rom_id)(const char *name, const char *gamename);
    const char **file_extension;
    int num_of_rom_slots;
    int num_of_floppy_drives;
    int num_of_hard_drives;
    int num_of_cassette_drives;
#endif

New:
#ifdef MESS
    const struct IODevice *dev;
#endif


* The global rom_name[], floppy_name[], hard_name[] and cassette_name[]
arrays are gone! Instead each machine driver (src/mess/systems/*.c)
should specify an init function for every device it supports.
This init function is called during the startup with an id (0 to max
instances of the device - 1) and a filename.
The driver can either store the filename locally to access it later,
or already do something with the file, like loading and decoding it
like the apple2 driver seems to do it (seems, because I didn't understand
too much of the code :)

* rom_load is called very early when a driver is started.
It is the 'init' function for the device type IO_CARTSLOT, so the
previous statement applies here too. 

* the rom_id function pointer moved into the struct IODevice too.
Every device can have a id function, so if it is possible to identify
eg. a floppy disk, harddisk, cassette ect., you should provide the
identifying functions and put them in this field in your systems/driver code.
The id function return value is sort of TRUE/FALSE, ie. non zero
means image is ok for this device, zero is not recognized.

* The IODevice contains an "void (*exit)(int id);" entry, so each
driver could (and probably should) handle shutting down the various
device instances.
The exit entries are called from src/mess/mess.c exit_devices(),
which is called from src/mame.c shutdown_machine().

* Startup handling moved from src/mame.c to src/mess/mess.c
In the first stage load_image() is called.
The images specified on the command line are parsed in mess.c now, and
a list of "struct ImageFile" entries in the GameOptions is set.
This struct contains a "char *name" and an "int type", where type should
be set to one of the IO_CARTSLOT, IO_FLOPPY ect. values.
GUI ports could use this to store some file selection lists together with
the type of files selected.
The DOS port stores image names from the command line (*argv) in this
array, and the type of image is determined this way:
1st: user specified a type using a switch before a (list of) name(s).
     For DOS this looks like "mess system -floppy test -rom rom1 rom2"
2nd: the extension of the filename matches one of the MessDevice entries
     of the driver which is started. So if a driver defines "cas" for
     it's IO_CASSETTE device and "dsk" for it's IO_FLOPPY device, the
     command line "mess driver a.dsk b.cas" will be sufficient.
3rd: if the image type is not know, it is stored along with a type of
     IO_CARTSLOT.

* In the second stage during startup, the get_files() function is called
and images are sorted into some (static) arrays of names in mess.c.
This is to allow easier/faster access to them and maybe useful for
swapping the names and calling init_<device> again.

* The third stage now walks through the list of devices of the driver
which is to be started and calls it's init functions with the the
names from the arrays. If the driver returns non zero, the startup
process is terminated here.

CP400                          [Nate Woods]



These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------
- Support added for CoCo 3 hires graphics [Nate Woods]

- Fixes to the cgenie vidhrdw code. [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Trs80, removed video x*2/y*3 hacks. The character layout is now 
  6x12.  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- VZ fixes [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed the color graphics modes for Dragon/CoCo2. 
  [Nate Woods, Mathis Rosenhauer]

- Minor improvements to the graphics display in the amstrad driver. 
  A border is shown and the screen is centralised in the horizontal. 
  Vertical centering not done properly done yet.  Graphics routines 
  use plot_pixel so work in 8-bit and 16-bit colour. [Kev Thacker]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:

Other drivers changes:
----------------------
- amstrad disk image support!  thanks to nec765 floppy disc controller 
  emulation.  This provides loading of disk images in the CPCEMU 
  standard and extended disk image formats (the most common format 
  available on the net)  [Kev Thacker]

- Changed the cgenie driver to use the opbaseoverride() to load a 
  .cas file from the command line. This works for unprotected, binary
  *.cas files only, though.  From inside the emulation you can still 
  load binary images with the SYSTEM command and BASIC files with 
  CLOAD"<letter>.  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Fixed some minor cgenie problems, like loading *.cas files from 
  inside the emulation with names shorter than 6 characters.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- KIM-1 driver works without backdrop now [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Kaypro 2x works again [Juergen Buchmueller]

- TRS80, fixed .cas/.cmd loader using opbaseoverride(). The image is 
  loaded as soon as the BASIC prompt is show (">" in line 4) and 
  floppy controller is disabled in trs80_init() when no floppy disk
  image is specified.  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- Jupiter Ace now includes support for .ace and .tap files.

- Jupiter - modified the vidhrdw code to use drawgfx() instead of 
  modifying the bitmap's single pixels, corrected the GfxLayout for 
  jupiter_charlayout and used it with decodechar() whenever the 
  character set is changed in jupiter_charram_w(), and changed to the 
  generic videoram/videoram_size/videoram_w and dirtybuffer variables 
  and functions (note how they are initialized in the writememory 
  definition).  You can now see the current character set with UI and 
  F4.  [Juergen Buchmueller]

- The core is based on MAME 0.36b7. This incorporates all features 
  of the update to this core (such as sidewinder fixes).  [MAME team]

- Aliases now supported again!  Just to remind everyone, it allows 
  you to specify a set of ROMs or disk images with a short name in 
  the mess.cfg file.
  eg.:
  [trs80]
  arcade = boot.dsk,arcade1.dsk,arcade2.dsk,arcade3.dsk

  You can then call 'mess trs80 arcade' and have all four disks 
  inserted instead of typing the full command line.

- You can now specify in MESS.CFG the *exact* directory a rom is 
  which you want to run.  no longer necessray to have a directory with 
  the same name as the system [Juergen Buchmueller] 
  
- 'clone' systems now supported.  The system BIOS is loaded from 
  either the parent set (zipped) or the clone set (same as MAME).  
  Roms/Images can reside in either the parent or clone subdirectory. 
  [Ben Bruscella]





===================================================================

0.36b6

PLEASE NOTE: MESS is now developed and distributed as a MAME source 
override, hence the MESS version number leap ;-) There are many 
advantages to developing MESS this way, however, one major downside was 
that *all* the previous MESS system drivers had to be modified for the 
new MAME cores. So, as a consequence, not all systems work properly in 
this release, and THERE ARE SYSTEMS IN THIS RELEASE WHICH *MAY* HAVE 
PROBLEMS THAT DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE. We have tried our best to ensure that 
all the drivers from the last release are working as good as before (in 
most cases better), but there is no guarantee.

Enjoy!  Please report all problems to the message board at:

http://mess.emuverse.com/


New drivers supported (in no particular order):
-----------------------------------------------

Amstrad CPC [Kevin Thacker]

These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Misc. mapper and PPU fixes for the NES. [Brad Oliver, Firebug, Fx3]

- Rewrite of Sega MasterSystem/GameGear code. It is now much more playable
  than before. [Charles Mac Donald]

- Better color imager support for the Vectrex. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

- Vectrex Driver overlay support. [Mathis Rosenhauer]


These drivers have new or improved SOUND:
-----------------------------------------

- Adjusted timing of NES clock to be accurate. [Brad Oliver]

- Sound in the Astrocade driver. [Frank Palazzolo]

- Preliminary Mockingboard support for the Apple II. [Brad Oliver]

- Genesis sound improvements. [Gareth Long]



Other driver changes:
----------------------

- Several drivers have had compatibility improved (eg. NES, Genesis and Coleco)

- The Apple II drivers have been fleshed out a little more. The //e
  family now works. The disk emulation is significantly faster as well.
  There is still plenty of work to be done though. [Brad Oliver]

- Bug fixes to the TI9928a video code. This affects the ColecoVision and the
  TI-994a drivers. [Raphael Nabet, Sean Young]

- There are major keyboard problems with most of the emulated computer
  systems (eg apple2, kaypro, ti99).  This is known, and we are looking 
  into it.  


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- The core is based on MAME 0.36b6. [MAME team]

- Zipped cart and image support added. To use, make sure that the zip has the
  same name as the file in the zip. (eg) for a coleco CART called
  "venture.rom", zip to "venture.zip".  When running MESS, type "mess coleco
  venture.rom".  MESS will then load "venture.rom" from "venture.zip".  Any
  system roms can also be zipped and placed anywhere in you ROMPATH. (eg)
  coleco.rom in coleco.zip.
  [Ben Bruscella]

- GAME_COMPUTER flag added.  Use this to specify that the system requires
  full keyboard emulation.  Emulated Computer systems now use the 
  scroll_lock key to toggle the keyboard emulation.  When on, MAME keys 
  (such as "P" for pause) are disabled, until toggled with the scroll_lock.
  [Juergen Buchmueller]


Source:
-------

- [DOS] MAKEFILE/compilation changes. To compile MESS, simply make sure you
  can compile MAME. Then, apply the MESS source over-ride and:

   1. Rename MAKEFILE to MAKEFILE.mm
   2. Rename MAKEFILE.MES MAKEFILE
   3. Type MAKE

  The goal is to have no MAME files over-written to compile MESS, although
  this may not be possible for every release.

- Basically, theres too much to keep track of here since the last release!   
  Documentation will return to normal next release ;-)

Source:
-------

- The DOS version is now compiled with GCC 2.8.1 and using Allegro 3.0 + WIP
  (30th May).

- [DOS] To improve portability, the makefile is more conservative, using the
  -pedantic and -Wshadow switches. Note that to compile with these switches,
  several changes had to be made to allegro.h, which is included.
