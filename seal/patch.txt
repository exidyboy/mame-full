This is a patch that must be applied over SEAL 1.0.7 in order for sound
to work properly on 16-bit cards.

If this patch is not applied, there will be a noticeable background noise
because the library only uses the 8 most significant bits of each sample
and throws away the others.

Don't forget to recompile the library after applying the patch, and to copy
it into the djgpp/lib directory!
